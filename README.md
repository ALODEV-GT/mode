# mode
## Task Description:
Create a function that receives a list of elements and determines its mode. The function should return the result following these specifications:

If there is a single element with the highest frequency, the function should indicate that the list is unimodal and return its mode.
If there are two elements with the same maximum frequency, the function should indicate that the list is bimodal and return both modes.
If three or more elements share the same maximum frequency, the function should indicate that the list has no mode.
